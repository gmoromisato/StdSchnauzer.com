	<b>WHAT IS A STANDARD SCHNAUZER?</b>
	<br />
	&quot;The dog with the human brain&quot;. The original breed of the 3 sizes of Schnauzers, 
	they are a handsome, head-turning, robust, squarely-built, medium size dog with 
	aristocratic bearing. The coat is harsh, wiry and minimal shedding and is pepper and 
	salt or solid black in color. They are sociable, alert, a comedian, a formidable guard 
	and a family companion. Properly raised and trained, they are reliable companions with their 
	own family children. They are usually not unnecessary barkers. They are noted for guarding 
	the family home and displaying devotion to their immediate family. 
	<br />
	<br clear="all" />
	<b>HOW LARGE IS A STANDARD SCHNAUZER? </b>
	<br />
	The Standard Schnauzer is a medium-sized dog. Males are ideally between 18-20&quot; high
	at the shoulders and generally weigh about 35-50 pounds. Females are ideally between 
	17-19&quot; inches high at the shoulders and generally weigh about 30-45 pounds. 
	<br />
	<br clear="all" />
	<b>IS THE STANDARD SCHNAUZER AN EFFECTIVE WATCH DOG? </b>
	<br />
	As a home guardian, the Standard Schnauzer excels. Properly introduced, they readily
	accept close friends of the family. However, they warn away any stranger with a strong 
	voice. Woe unto the attacker or intruder!

<div class="pfont1 l760">
	<b>IS THE STANDARD SCHNAUZER A GOOD PET?  </b>
	<br />
	Yes, for the right person. The Standard Schnauzer is not the breed for 
	those who want a placid, friendly-to-everyone dog that can be fed, 
	walked and forgotten. The Standard Schnauzer insists on being a part 
	of the family activities and develops to its fullest potential when treated 
	in this manner. For this reason, most Standards, even the top show winners, are house 
	pets. Raised and trained properly, they are very good with their own family children 
	and most others who respect their high sense of self-dignity. They are not a dog that 
	readily accepts any form of teasing, especially from children. Their memory for 
	people and events is akin to the proverbial &quot;memory of an elephant&quot;.

<div class="pfont1 r516">
	<b>IS THE STANDARD SCHNAUZER TRAINABLE? </b>
	<br />
	Due to their intelligence, they do learn quickly and will retain most everything 
	they learn, including unintended lessons. The Standard Schnauzer needs direction that 
	is consistent and firm (but not rough). They have a tendency to push the envelope, 
	try to get away with whatever they can and will rule the house if allowed. 
	As an all-around performance event dog, it is hard to beat the Standard Schnauzer, 
	as they can excel in obedience, agility and herding, infusing both enthusiasm and 
	intelligence in the execution of their &quot;tasks&quot;. However, because they can 
	be a comedian, there are occasions when they can be quite creative in the way they perform.

<div class="pfont1 l760">
	<b>WHAT ABOUT GROOMING?</b>
	<br />
	Every dog, no matter what the breed, needs some basic maintenance: nails clipped, ears cleaned, 
	coat brushed. The Standard Schnauzer, however, requires even more grooming, as do all 
	wire-coated breeds. Beard and leg hair must be combed and brushed often enough to 
	prevent the formation of mats. Generally, a Standard Schnauzer's coat must be 
	hand-stripped at 4 to 6 month intervals. Hand stripping (or plucking) is absolutely 
	necessary if you plan to show your dog or like the look and feel of the proper coat. 
	House pets can be machine-clippered by a local groomer. This is a simpler process of 
	maintaining the look of the Schnauzer, however, over time the texture of the coat will soften. 
	A properly groomed and maintained wire-coated dog like the Standard Schnauzer sheds minimally. 
	The Standard Schnauzer Club of America has a grooming guide available which gives guidelines 
	on how to maintain both the hand-stripped and the machine-clippered coat.

<div class="pfont1 l760">
	<b>WHERE SHOULD I BUY A STANDARD SCHNAUZER?</b>
	<br />
	From a reputable breeder. This breed is not always easy to find, as they are not bred in 
	great numbers. To obtain a puppy, you should go directly to a breeder who is a member 
	of a regional Standard Schnauzer Club or a member of the Standard Schnauzer Club of 
	America. The SSCA maintains a breeder referral list comprised of SSCA breeders who 
	have signed a Code of Ethics. As a rule, Standard Schnauzer breeders do not breed merely 
	to produce puppies, but have a breeding plan based on a certain lineage which they hope 
	will improve the breed as a whole. Buying directly from a breeder is not just a business 
	transaction. The worst place to buy any puppy is a pet shop.

<div class="pfont1 l526">
	<b>DOES THE STANDARD SCHNAUZER HAVE HEALTH-RELATED PROBLEMS?</b>
	<br />
	Standard Schnauzers are above-average as compared with most other breeds when it comes to 
	health issues. They live an average of 13 to 16 extremely active years. Most Standard 
	Schnauzer owners find that only an annual visit to their veterinarian for a check-up and
	routine shots is required.
	<br /><br />
	Occasionally, problems that occur in other breeds will crop up in the Standard Schnauzer. 
	Some of these problems pose severe health problems to the dogs and big heartaches to their
	breeders and owners. The SSCA has formed a health committee to try to insure that no disease
	or problem that is possibly genetic in nature ever becomes a widespread problem in this otherwise
	very healthy breed. It was only through the efforts of concerned breeders many years ago 
	that the problem of hip dysplasia has been sharply reduced in the United States. The SSCA 
	continues to recommend that all breeding stock owned by members be radiographed free of hip dysplasia.

<div class="pfont1 l760">
	<b>DOES THE STANDARD SCHNAUZER HAVE HEALTH-RELATED PROBLEMS?</b>
	<br />	Although eye problems rarely show up in the Standard Schnauzer, the SSCA also recommends 
	that breeding stock be tested annually.
	<br /><br />
	The majority of Standard Schnauzer breeders are working together to keep the breed as free 
	of genetic problems as possible. We currently enjoy saying, and wish to continue to be able
	to say, that the major problem leading to cause of death in this breed is just plain old age.
