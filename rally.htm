			AKC Rally is the new dog sport that is taking the nation by storm, a successful 
			stepping stone from the AKC Canine Good Citizen® program to the world of obedience 
			or agility. Rally offers both the dogs and handlers an experience that is fun and 
			energizing. The canine team moves through the stations at their own speed, very 
			similar to rally-style auto racing. Rally was designed with the traditional pet 
			owner in mind, but it can still be very challenging for those who enjoy higher 
			levels of competition.
			<br /><br />
			A rally course includes 10 to 20 stations, depending on the level. Scoring is not as 
			rigorous as traditional obedience. Communication between handler and dog is encouraged 
			and perfect heel position is not required, but there should be a sense of teamwork 
			between the dog and handler. The main objective of rally is to produce dogs that have 
			been trained to behave in the home, in public places, and in the presence of other dogs, 
			in a manner that will reflect positively on the sport of rally at all times and under all conditions. 
			<br /><br />
			The three levels of competition in AKC Rally: 
			</p>
			<h2 class="h2style"><b>Novice</b> - this is the first level for those just getting started in competition. </h2>
			<ul class="uldisc">
				<li>All exercises are performed with the dog on leash.</li>
				<li>There is a requirement of 10-15 stations to complete with no more than five stationary exercises.</li>
				<li>The exercises performed vary from turning 360 degrees to changing paces during the course.</li>
				<li>Exhibitors at this level may clap their hands and pat their legs through the course.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 class="h2style"><b>Advanced</b> - this is the second level, which includes more difficult exercises throughout the course.</h2> 
			<ul class="uldisc">
				<li>All exercises are performed off-leash.</li>
				<li>There is a requirement of 12-17 stations with no more than seven stationary exercises.</li>
				<li>Exercises include a jump as well as calling your dog to the front of you instead of to a heel position.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 class="h2style"><b>Excellent</b> - this third and highest level of AKC Rally is the most challenging.</h2>
			<ul class="uldisc">
				<li>Exercises are performed off-leash except for the honor exercise.</li>
				<li>There is a requirement of 15-20 stations, with no more than 7 stationary exercises.</li>
				<li>Handlers are only allowed to encourage their dogs verbally. 
					Physical encouragement is not allowed at this level.</li> 
				<li>The Excellent-level exercises include backing up three steps, while the dog 
					stays in the heel position and a moving stand, while the handler walks around the dog.</li>
			</ul>
