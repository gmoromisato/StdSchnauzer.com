Walk Particulars:  
<br /><br />
Walk starts at 8:30 at the Marina Entrance.
<br /><br />
Length of Walk:  An easy 2 hour walk (+/- depends on you and your dog's fitness needs).
<br /><br />
SSCNC General Members Meeting will Follow:  Starts around 10:30 - for those who may want
to attend the meeting but not necessarily partake in the walk
<br /><br />
Address for Lake Chabot:   17930 Lake Chabot Road,  Castro Valley
<br /><br />
There is plenty of shade where we will be parking and  a picnic area where we will 
be having the meeting.  You may want to have your dog's Rabies vaccine proof with 
you in case they ask and with all parks these days, there is a fee prepare accordingly.
<br /><br />
The Picnic area by the Marina entrance is our staging area and we will have members 
holding tables and staying at the picnic area while others walk.   Bring water for 
yourself and your dog for the walk-- and of course those pooper bags.  All dogs are 
required to be on SIX FOOT Leashes on the trails.   No Flexi-leads.
<br /><br />
SSCNC will have snacks and beverages after the walk and for the meeting.   
An Agenda for the meeting will be sent to the SSCNC membership prior to the meeting.
<br /><br />
Hope to see a lot of you there.  Castro Valley is usually cooled by the fog coming 
through the bay so the walk should be a very nice way to spend a Sunday morning with 
your favorite schnauzer (or three).
