			Tests:  The purpose of noncompetitive herding tests is to offer herding breed 
			owners a standardized gauge by which a dog's basic instinct and trainability 
			are measured. Dogs must have training and prior exposure to livestock before 
			being entered in tests or trials.  Livestock can be Ducks/Geese, Sheep/Goats 
			or Cattle at any given test or trial and some dogs are better with certain 
			types of stock than others.
			<br clear="all" />
			
			<h3 class="h3style">Instinct Test</h3>
			It is a test for herding breeds, and judge is looking for the dogs ability to 
			move and control livestock by fetching or driving.   The dog needs no training 
			before entering this class and may be handled by the judge, owner or a designated handler. 
			
			<h3 class="h3style">Herding Test (HT)</h3>
			This test requires the dogs to work the livestock with 
			the owner in a defined space and along a defined route, ensuring that the dog is 
			controlled at the beginning with a pause before engaging the sheep and at the end by 
			requiring the dog to make a conscious choice to come to the handler and come off the stock.  
			If the dog completes the course under two judges successfully, they earn the title of HT.
			
			<h3 class="h3style">Pre-Trial Test (PT)</h3>
			This test is an expanded HT course that usually requires a lesson or two before 
			competing.  The course uses panels and requires the dogs to stay until instructed 
			to engage the sheep, a pause someplace along the course to ensure the dog and 
			livestock are under control and a re-penning of the sheep at the end.  Like the 
			HT, the dog must demonstrate these skills under two separate Judges to earn the 
			PT Title.
			<br /><br />
			<h2 class="h2style">Trials</h2>
			<img style="padding-right: 4px;" src="images/herding/herding2.jpg" align="left" width="302" height="230" alt="hering 2" />
			The purpose of the competitive herding trial program is to preserve and develop the 
			herding skills inherent in the herding breeds and to demonstrate that they can 
			perform the useful functions for which they were originally bred. Although 
			herding trials are artificial simulations of pastoral or farm situations, 
			they are standardized tests to measure and develop the characteristics of 
			the herding breeds. 
			<br /><br />
			As soon as you get a puppy, you can get them to chase things and then get them 
			to stop on command. Have them stay while you throw that favorite toy. 
			Basically you are putting rules on the game of chasing. Take your young dog 
			to a facility and just get them use to listening to you while around livestock 
			and pens. It is important that you own the game.
			<br /><br />
			Each dog is different. Some need encouragement while others need to learn 
			to listen while livestock is being worked around them.
