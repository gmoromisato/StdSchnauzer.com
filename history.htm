<p>
The Standard Schnauzer Club of Northern California was formed on
May 1, 1943 and is one of the oldest regional Standard Schnauzer Clubs
in the United States.
</p>
<p>
Among some of the early members were Sophronia Bunker,
the owner of one of the outstanding stud dogs in Standard Schnauzers,
Ch. Nickel St. Gallus;
Frances Districh, owner of the von&nbsp;Districhburg Kennels; 
the Rothes (von Hahlweg Kennels); Bobby Burns Berman (BBB Kennels); 
and the Aronstams (Stone Pine Kennels).     
Some later members influential in the breed included Sylvia Hammarstrom (Skansen Kennels);  
Carol Earle-Davis (Tsunami Lines); and Marve McCabe.
</p>
<p>
Many of our current members go back 20 and 30 years as members of the SSCNC.
These members are Charles Aronstam,  Mary Dunn, Anne Lorini, Bill Farinon,
John and Arlene Lonsdale, Franzi Diaz, and Stuart &amp; Helen O'Brien.
</p>
<p>
Some of the current activities sponsored by SSCNC for its members can be traced back to 
the mid 1970s - these include, Grooming Day, the regional Specialty and the Annual Christmas Party.  
Though originally founded by those persons who showed and bred their dogs, today's 
SSCNC is primarily a place to learn about the Standard Schnauzer.   Many of today's owners 
are interested in Conformation and Obedience showing, but just as many are interested in 
Therapy Dog visiting, Agility, Herding and some of the newer sports such as Free-Style 
Obedience, Rally-O Obedience, Backpacking, Schutzhund, and Weight pulling.
</p>
<p>
The one thing that has not changed since we began is our desire 
to help new people learn about this versatile breed.
