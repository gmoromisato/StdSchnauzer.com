			Conformation showing is often referred to as the "canine beauty contest"; when in fact, 
			conformation showing started as an organized manner for Breeders to show off their breeding 
			stock. It is still the primary way Breeders have to exhibit their top dogs and bitches, 
			before educated Judges, to solicit the Judge's subjective evaluation of their breeding lines. 
			<br /><br />
			<img src="images/conformation/prettySSline_up.jpg" align="left" width="480" height="368" alt="eukanabe lineup">
			To be considered a Conformation Champion (the "CH" in front of the dog's registered name 
			e.g. CH. Over The Top Dog), the dog must have earned 15 points in various conformation 
			shows. The points are earned by defeating other dogs of their sex and/or by defeating 
			all the dogs or bitches entered in that breed's showing at a particular show. 
			Points are determined by how many of the dogs are entered in the Breed competition 
			at that show and can range from 1 point to 5 points. A show that has enough dogs 
			entered to be considered worth 3, 4 or 5 points is called a "major". A dog must 
			have won at two or more shows that are considered "majors" as part of the 15 points 
			needed to be a Champion. In other words, to be a Champion the dog (or bitch) must 
			have won at least two shows worth 3 or more points and earn an additional 9 points 
			in other shows. There is no time limit on how long you have to earn the 15 points 
			once you start.
			<br /><br />
			To enter a Conformation show a dog must be six months of age, be a purebred 
			specimen of a recognized breed and have no disqualifying faults (as outlined 
			in the Breed Standards) or physical lameness. 
			<br /><br />
			Prior to Six months of age, puppies may enter Sanctioned "B"-Matches for fun 
			and for the learning experience. Ribbons are awarded the winners in Breed 
			and in Groups, but no Championship points are awarded at the Matches. Matches 
			are a great place to practice and receive some friendly feedback on your dog's 
			overall suitability for Conformation showing.
			<br /><br />
			Conformation shows are predominately un-benched - meaning that when the dog is 
			done showing for the day, its owner or handler are free to leave the show grounds. 
			Benched shows (of which there are only five left in the United States) require 
			that all exhibitors remain in a "benching area" when they are not showing so that 
			the public may view the dogs. Golden Gate Kennel Club's show at the Cow Palace 
			during the first weekend in February is the only west coast benched show. 
			<br /><br />
			Conformation showing starts at the Breed level. The Breed level is all the other 
			dogs of your breed entered to show that day. Dogs and Bitches are separated into 
			Puppy Categories of 6-9 months and 9-12 months and into other categories including 
			12-18 month dogs, Open, Bred-By-Exhibitor, and Amateur Owner-Handler, and 
			American Bred.     Winners from each of the categories compete against one another 
			for the Winner's Bitch and Winner's Dog. The Winners of the Bitch and Dog entries 
			receive the points toward their championship. The Winner's Bitch (WB) and Winner's 
			Dog (WD) enter the ring with already Championed dogs (Called Specials) to compete 
			or Best of Breed (BOB), Best Opposite Sex (BOS) and Best of Winners (BOW). 
			<br /><br />
			<a href="pdf/Understand_Dog_Shows.pdf" target="_blank">A flow chart to understand the conformation dog show.</a>
			<br /><br />
			Occasionally, there are dogs over seven years of age entered to compete for 
			Best of Breed. All the dogs over seven years of age compete in a Veterans class 
			to determine the best Veteran to send to the Best of Breed Competition. 
			<br /><br />
			While in the ring, a Judge studies each dog entered from the sixth month old 
			puppy to the aged Veteran. The Judge is guided by his or her interpretation 
			of each Breed's written Standard. The Standard is the "ideal" specimen the 
			Judge is looking for. The Judge uses his eyes and his hands to exam the dogs 
			individually. He checks the color of the eyes, the texture of the coat, 
			the muscles and angulations of the joints. The Judge will ask each exhibitor 
			to move their dog around the ring and then move the dog away from and back 
			toward the Judge so that the Judge has an opportunity to see that if everything 
			he has seen and felt is reflected in the dog's movement. The Judge awards 
			ribbons based on what he or she has seen in the ring that day. 
			<br /><br />
			<span style="background-color: #b4b4b4;">
			Beginning in July 2010 the AKC has started a new program called “Grand Champion”.   
			This program continues to award points for dogs that are Specials.   
			Dogs earn points towards their Grand Champion title in a similar manner
			as they did to become a Champion.  After accumulating 25 points as a Special, 
			a dog earns the Title of Grand Champion.</span>

			The Best of Breed winners from each breed compete later the same day in the Group Competition. 
			<br /><br />
			There are Seven Groups: Working, Herding, Sporting, Hounds, Non-Sporting, Terrier and Toys. 
			<br /><br />
			These groups are divided by the various form and functions that each of the Breeds in that Group performed. 
			<br /><br />
			A different Judge goes over each dog in each of the Groups and after the examination, 
			awards the One through Four winners for each of the seven Groups. 
			<br /><br />
			The Group winners from each Group compete in the Best In Show Competition in which 
			one dog is determined to be the closest to their individual Breed Standard at that show for that day.
			<br /><br />			
			In addition to All Breed Shows, dogs can compete in Specialty conformation shows to 
			earn points toward their Championships. An All Breed show is a Conformation show in which 
			only dogs of the same breed compete for ribbons, prizes and trophies. Specialty shows 
			can be sponsored by regional breed clubs and by a National Breed Club. The National Club 
			sponsors the big annual event called "The National Specialty", where all dogs in the 
			country vie for Best of Breed honors. 
			<br /><br />
			In Canada, Conformation shows are conducted pretty much the same as they are in the 
			United States. To become a Canadian Champion the dog must earn 10 points to be considered
			a Champion and to determine the total number of points per show, the total number of dogs 
			and bitches are added together. 
			<br /><br />
			In Europe and under the FCI Federation rules, dogs do not compete against one another 
			for Champion Certificates, but rather, receive a written evaluation by a Judge on the 
			dogs overall adherence to the Breed Standard. The dog must receive three Champion 
			Certificates from three different Judges, two Judges must reside in a country other 
			than where the dog resides. There may be three or four dogs of the same breed who each 
			earned one of the three Champion Certificates needed to be an International Champion, 
			that day. The very best of these "Excellent" specimens compete for Best of Breed 
			to see who goes to the Group Ring. 
			<br /><br />
			There are several opportunities in the United States to participate in the FCI 
			style Conformation shows. You can find one near you at 
			<a href="http://www.iabca.com" target="_blank">their web page.</a>
