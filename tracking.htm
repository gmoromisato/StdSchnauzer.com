			Tracking Tests allow dogs to demonstrate their natural ability to recognize 
			and follow human scent. This vigorous outdoor activity is great for canine 
			athletes. Unlike Agility and Obedience events that require a dog to qualify 
			three times, a dog only needs to complete one track successfully to earn each 
			title. Owners find joy in seeing the dogs at work using their innate scenting 
			skills and being outdoors.
			<h2 class="h2style">Tracking Levels of Competition</h2>
			<h3 class="h3style">Tracking Dog (TD)</h3>
			A dog earns a TD by following a track 440 to 500 yards long with 
			three to five changes of direction. The track is laid by a human tracklayer and is 
			"aged" 30 minutes to two hours before the dog begins scenting. The goal is to use the 
			scented track to locate an article left at the end of the trail by the tracklayer. 
			The owner follows the dog on a long leash and can encourage the dog during the tracking test.
			
			<h3 class="h3style">Tracking Dog Excellent (TDX)</h3>
			The TDX is earned by following an "older" track (three to five hours) that is also 
			longer (800 to 1,000 yard) and has five to seven directional changes with the additional 
			challenge of human cross tracks.
			
			<h3 class="h3style">Variable Surface Tracking (VST)</h3>
			In the real world, dogs track through urban settings, as well as through wilderness. 
			A VST dog has demonstrated this ability by following a three- to five-hour-old track 
			that may take him down a street, through a building and other areas devoid of vegetation. 

			<h3 class="h3style">Champion Tracker (CT)</h3>
			A dog that has successfully completed all three tracking titles (TD, TDX and VST) 
			earns the prestigious title of Champion Tracker.
