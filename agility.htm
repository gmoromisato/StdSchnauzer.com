			Running a dog in an agility trial is the ultimate game for you and your dog and is one 
			of the most exciting canine sports for spectators. In an agility trial, a dog demonstrates 
			its agile nature and versatility by following cues from the handler through a timed obstacle 
			course of jumps, tunnels, weave poles and other objects. Agility is a time and fault sport 
			where the qualifying requirements are more challenging as the competition class levels get higher.

			<h2 class="h2style">Levels of Agility Competition</h2>
			<h3 class="h3style">NOVICE</h3>
			For the dog that is just starting in agility. There are 13 to 15 obstacles on this course. 
			The focus of the Novice class is on performing the obstacles with minimal handling technique. 
			<h3 class="h3style">OPEN</h3>
			For the dog that has completed the Novice level. There are 16 to 18 obstacles on this course. 
			The focus of the open class is on more difficult obstacle course performance with more 
			handling skill required.
			<h3 class="h3style">EXCELLENT</h3>
			For the dog that has completed the open level. There are 18 – 20 obstacles on this 
			course. The focus of the Excellent A &amp; B class is to provide the opportunity for dogs 
			and handlers to demonstrate their superior skills in moving quickly and efficiently with 
			close communication and teamwork through challenging agility courses. The Excellent B 
			level is the class where handler-dog teams can earn the title, Master Agility 
			Champion (MACH), in the Regular Classes.
