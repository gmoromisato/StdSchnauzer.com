Every year, through no fault of their own,
Standard Schnauzers and/or their owners find
themselves in the distressing situation of having to
relinquish ownership of their pets.
<br /><br />
Many causes include illness, age, lose of a job or
home. Sometimes the reasons are less pleasant
such as a puppy mill raid, being left tied to a post
on a busy city block or abuse and neglect cases.
<br /><br />
Although we get many reports from local shelters and rescue groups about Standard
Schnauzers being in a shelter situation, we rarely find that the dog in the shelter is in
fact a Standard Schnauzer. Sadly, many are miniature schnauzers and we work
closely with local shelters, other all breed rescue contacts and breeders to ensure that
no Schnauzer languishes in a shelter once it is brought to our attention. SSCNC
Rescue puts the best interest of the dog first; so you may feel as if you, as a
perspective new owner, are being scrutinized, but it is our goal to ensure that every
dog that comes to us as a Rescue or a Re-Home request finds their “fur ever” home.
Rescue also works with the Original Owners and Breeders to help find new homes.
<br /><br />
All SSCNC members support and aid the Rescue effort when we hear that one of our “family”
members needs help and we will continue to work with those in other rescue organizations to ensure
that our dogs return to loving homes as soon as possible.
<br /><br />
Rescue can often be a long process since, thankfully, we do not receive but a handful of calls about a
Standard Schnauzer in need of a new home.
<br /><br />
If you want to adopt / rescue a Standard Schnauzer please print and fill out the Adoption Form (link
below) and we will get in touch with you about the application and when we have adoptable dogs
available. <a href="pdf/SSCNC_2010_Adoption_Form.pdf" target="_blank">Rescue Application.</a>
