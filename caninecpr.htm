This event is still in the Planning Stage with the Instructor.  Details will be posted as they become available. 
<br /><br />
We are planning the class to take place in Dublin/Pleasanton/San Ramon area and on a Sunday.  
We are looking at a date that will be either late September or early November.  
Space for this event will be limited and opened to the general dog owning public with 
SSCNC Members/Applicants having registration priority.   There will be a cost to all who 
attend this training and a limit to the number of people who can enroll.  This is one of 
usually only two no dogs included events SSCNC has per year.
<br /><br />
The training will be on the basics of dog first aid and CPR.  A great course for anyone 
who travels, hikes, works, trials or lives with a dog.  Learn what to do to stablize a 
bite wound or treat heat stroke before you can get the dog to a Veterinarian. 
<br /><br />
Stay tuned as we finalize date and cost for this important learning opportunity.
