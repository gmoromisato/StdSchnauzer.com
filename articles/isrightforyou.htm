			</p>

<ul>
<li>Have you owned a schnauzer before?</li>
<li>Have you owned a breed of dog characterized as being "stubborn" before?</li>
<li>Have you lived with a dog who wants to be a part of everything you do?</li>
<li>Have you owned a breed of dog from the Working or Herding groups in the past?</li>
</ul>

<p>
Answer "NO" to any of these questions and the Standard Schnauzer is probably not t
he best choice for a first time dog owner.  
</p>
<p>
This is a breed known as "the dog with the human brain" and it comes with that 
distinction for a reason.  If they sense that you are not going to be the boss 
in your relationship with the dog, then they will quickly assume the leadership 
role and rule your home with an iron jaw.  This breed of dog will un-plant your 
prized rose bushes in search of a gopher.  They can leap vertically from a sit, 
five feet in the air and scale a six foot fence with the right incentive.  They 
have a highly developed sense of order and will chase cats (if not raised with them), 
herd your family birds and your children, and bully other dogs.  In fact, they 
will bully grown adults, if permitted.
</p>
<p>
The Standard Schnauzer is a medium sized dog with a terrier-esque appearance and 
the working dog interior and sense of duty.
</p>
<p>
By medium sized dog we mean the males are between 18 and 20 inches at the top of 
their shoulders and weigh between 42 and 50 pounds.  Females are between 17 and 19 
inches at the top of their shoulders and weigh between 38 and 45 pounds.  There 
are individuals in the breed that can vary as much as an inch or two on either 
side of these measurements, but these animals are not considered within the written 
standard for the breed and should be considered family companions and performance 
dogs and not be bred.
</p>
<p>
Standard Schnauzers need EXERCISE.   A tired schnauzer is a good schnauzer.   
By exercise we mean an hour of hard play a day - swimming, running with other dogs, 
Frisbee and hiking are all good forms of exercise.   A leisurely stroll around 
the neighborhood blocks in the evening is not going to be enough exercise to 
ensure a good house companion for a young Standard.   
</p>
<p>
Standards Schnauzers eat between 12 ounces and 16 ounces a day of a natural 
diet or between one and two cups of a kibbled food and produce a like amount of waste.
</p>

<h3>Why Chose a Standard Schnauzer?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Looking for a unique companion dog?</li>
<li>Looking for a dog capable of doing Agility? Camping? High Levels of Obedience?  To be a Therapy dog?</li>
<li>Looking for a guard dog for your home and family?</li>
</ul>

<p>
Answer "YES" to these questions, and the Standard Schnauzer is probably the right dog for you 
</p>
<p>
This is a breed that loves to have a job to do, so early training is a MUST.   
Begin your new puppy in puppy training and socialization classes as soon as 12 
weeks of age.  There are many training courses now geared to puppies so check 
out the link to the American Pet Dog Trainers' Association web page under 
our "Outside Links" area, for a class near your home.
</p>
<p>
The Standard Schnauzer does not take up much more space in your home than its 
smaller cousin the Miniature Schnauzer, but has the bark and physical presence 
of its larger relative, the Giant Schnauzer.   They are odorless and non-shedding 
and well tolerated by people with allergies to dog fur because the Standard 
Schnauzer has hair very similar to human hair.
</p>

<h3>Cost of Owning Your First Schnauzer Puppy</h3>
<ul>
<li>$900.00 to $2,500.00 to purchase the Puppy (prices vary from region to 
region in the United States and whether you are buyer a family companion or a performance dog)</li>
<li>$35.00 - $100.00 for a Crate</li>
<li>$250.00 to $2,500.00  the first year for Vet Bills (shots, ears, preventative flea and heartworm medications)</li>
<li>$3.00 to $10.00 per week for Food and Treats</li>
<li>$150.00 to $1,500.00 the first year for Training</li>
<li>$45.00 to $150.00 per month in Grooming (pet grooming vs. grooming your show dog);</li>
<li>$100.00 to $350.00 for assorted toys, collars, bedding and AKC registration paperwork;</li>
<li>$50.00 to $5,000.00 to replace assorted home plants, furnishings, shoes, etc. 
If you do not train and crate your puppy appropriately as it develops</li>
</ul>

<p>
Obviously some of these costs can be minimized with proper exercise, training 
and management of your puppy while he or she is growing into the loving, 
comical and protective companion that you have heard the Standard Schnauzer 
can be.  Nurture and train your Standard Schnauzer consistently and kindly 
for the first 18 months of his or her life and you will have a lifetime 
companion who will go anywhere with you and do anything for you.
