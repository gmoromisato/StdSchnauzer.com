			<h2 class="h2style">Mouth Control (aka:  Stopping the biting and nipping games that puppies play)</h2>
Standard Schnauzer puppies love to show off their new teeth and use them whenever possible - 
including at inappropriate times and on inappropriate objects, like your hand!  
Nipping and jumping up during play sessions with children is very common and 
can be very frightening for the child.   So 
<strong>never leave your children and your schnauzer puppy alone in a room or 
during a play sessions,</strong>
as things can very quickly get out of hand (or mouth).  Remember, a puppy has 
very few experiences to learn how to express itself before it comes into your 
home and you are responsible for setting the boundaries and teaching the puppy 
appropriate play behaviors---mainly, controlling his mouth.   Up to this point 
he has been living with his littermates, they were much more tolerant of play 
nipping and rough biting.  What is necessary is to teach the new puppy that gentle 
mouthing in play is okay but strong biting will not be tolerated.  The best way to 
teach mouth control is with steady training.  Do not allow hard biting during one 
play session and then over react to the same hard biting at the next play session 
with a hard correction.
</p>
<p>
Take several small treats (soft textured treats if possible - hotdog pieces or 
string cheese cut into diced pieces ) hand feed them to puppy one treat at a 
time always using the command "TAKE IT"  as each treat is released to the pup.  
After several repetitions a treat is shown the puppy without the 'take it' command, 
if puppy attempts to take this treat (and he will) in a sharp voice give the 
command "LEAVE IT" or "DON"T TOUCH".  Puppy will most likely stop and look at you 
in a confused manner and he may even sit, if he knows that command, so praise him 
as soon as he does this and ignores the food tidbit.  Then give the command "TAKE IT" 
and release the treat to the puppy when he reaches for it.  Only praise and treat 
when he has stopped mouthing at the treat, and always remember to say "TAKE IT" 
before giving treat.  
</p>
<p>
Repeat this process several times a day for 2 days and at this point,  the puppy 
should have the idea of what 'OFF' or "LEAVE IT" means, and what "TAKE IT" MEANS.   
Now you can begin to incorporate these commands into daily events.   
</p>
<p>
Pick up a favorite toy and tell puppy "TAKE IT" and release the toy when he reaches 
for it.  Practice this once or twice a day then pick up a toy and say nothing, when 
puppy tries to grab the toy use the "LEAVE IT" or "DON'T TOUCH" command, when he 
lets go of the toy, praise and repeat 'take it' and let him have the toy.  Now 
when pup attempts to grab your favorite pair of leather shoes (which IDEALLY 
should be put where he can't get them to begin with), command "LEAVE IT" or "DON'T TOUCH" 
and your puppy should leave the shoe.  If he grabs the shoe open his jaws remove 
shoe and repeat "LEAVE IT" or "DON'T TOUCH" to reinforce the desired reaction and 
then replace the shoe with a doggy toy, and tell puppy to 'take it' confirming 
that he may play with his toys and not your shoes.
