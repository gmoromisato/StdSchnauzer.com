Teaching bite inhibition is the single most important thing you can teach your 
puppy or young dog. The dog must be taught to inhibit the force of its biting 
behavior so that it develops a soft mouth. It must also be taught to inhibit 
the frequency of its now gentler mouthing, so that the dog learns to keep its 
jaws to itself and never mouth any person or clothing. 
</p>
<p>
It is unrealistic to expect dogs never to be frightened or annoyed by people as 
it is to expect people never to frighten or annoy each other. However, just as 
it is reasonable to expect people to resolve their disagreements without physical 
violence, it is both realistic and perfectly feasible to teach dogs never to 
harm a person when scared or provoked. 
</p>
<p>
All dogs should be taught never to respond aggressively to any kind of provocation, 
but this is impossible in practice especially in instances of extreme and unexpected provocation. 
</p>
<p>
Puppy biting hurts but seldom causes harm. In fact, puppy-biting behavior is 
the way a young pup learns that its jaws can hurt. It is important that puppies 
learn to inhibit the force of their biting before they acquire the blunt yet 
sharp teeth and strong jaws of an older dog. 
</p>
<p>
There are quick ways to teach a puppy not to bite, however it often is only short 
term and does not always remain effective in adulthood. If the puppy is forbidden 
to bite, it will not learn that its jaws can inflict pain. If it is ever provoked 
to bite as an adult, the bite is likely to be a hard one, causing severe damage. 
Puppy biting must also be controlled but only in a progressive and systematic manner 
so that the pup is taught to inhibit the force of its bites. 
</p>
<p>
To inform the puppy that biting hurts, it is not necessary to hurt, frighten, 
punish or even reprimand the puppy. A simple 'ouch' is sufficient. If the puppy 
acknowledges the 'ouch' and stops biting, praise and continue playing. If the 
puppy ignores the reprimand, emphasize 'ooouuchh', stop playing and ignore the 
puppy. Puppies quickly learn that hard bites lose playmates. Return after one 
or two minutes of time out and make up buy having the puppy come, sit and calm 
down before play. Once the puppies mouthing no longer hurts, pretend that it 
does. Greet harder munches yelp of extreme pain! The puppy will begin to get the i
dea, thinking, 'Geez, these humans are SOOO sensitive, I have to be so 
gentle.' The biting will become mouthing and the mouthing will become gumming. 
</p>
<p>
Never allow a puppy to mouth human hair or clothing. Hair or clothing cannot 
feel pressure or pain. Allowing a pulpy to mouth hair, scarves, shoe-laces or 
gloved hands, trains it to bite harder, extremely close to human flesh! Once 
the puppy's mouthing no longer exerts any pressure, then you can teach the 
puppy to reduce the frequency. Teach the meaning of 'Off!' All too often when 
a dog has bitten severely, the case history reveals that the dog was 'fine' as a puppy. 
</p>
<p>
This is the major reason we go to great pains to encourage shy and standoffish 
dogs to play in puppy class. The most important survival lesson for a puppy to 
learn is that when it bites, it causes pain. Of course, the puppy can only learn 
this lesson if it bites and the bitee gives the appropriate feedback.
