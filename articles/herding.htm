Why are Standard Schnauzers competing in AKC herding tests and trials?  
</p>
<p>
There was a recent discussion on the Standard Schnauzer web list, prompted by recent 
successes in herding, at the National Specialty and some regional club workshops that 
led to this question - schnauzers herding?.  The ensuing discussions became centered 
on exactly why the Standard Schnauzer was or was not a herding breed.  If it is a 
herding breed, why isn't it shown in the AKC Herding Group with Old English Sheepdogs, 
Collies and Corgis?  What is in the Standard Schnauzer breeding or development that 
generated this herding interest in Standard Schnauzer owners?
</p>
<p>
And so, I find myself once again writing about a sport that is off the beaten path 
of those normally associated with our breed.  As a Novice in the herding field, I 
don't pretend to have any expert knowledge about herding, but I am happy to share 
with you what I have learned from my observations and participation for the past two years.
</p>
<p>
For the past four years, the Northern California Standard Schnauzer Club has been 
hosting an autumn herding workshop for its members.  I have participated with my 
Standard Schnauzers, for the last three years and have found I really enjoy this sport.  
Our local club boasts of having approximately twenty-four members and affiliates 
who have passed the initial test (HIT - Herding Instinct Test), and many have gone 
on and passed the secondary test (HCT - Herding Capability Test), and a few have 
even earned Jr. Herding Titles (JHT) under the auspices of the American Herding Breeds Association. 
</p>
<p>
The Standard Schnauzer is a highly driven dog and according to several other Nations 
written breed standards.  In other countries, the Standard Schnauzer character has 
been described as "highly developed senses, intelligent, ability to be trained, 
undaunted-ness, endurance and resistant to weather" (Germany); or as "strong, vigorous, 
capable of great endurance, alert, reliable and intelligent" (England); and finally, 
"high-spirited temperament with extreme reliability" (USA).   Those descriptive phrases, 
along with what we know about the breed's development and history as a farm dog, seem 
to predispose it to herding.  Herding was just one more skill the dog developed to 
help the farmer.  The strength and speed and the medium size of the Standard Schnauzer 
was ideal - it could do the jobs asked of it - ratting, guarding and herding - and 
till not eat too much or take up too much room in the barn or home or on the carts that went to market.
</p>
<p>
Those who have participated in a herding test have seen the natural instincts the 
Standard Schnauzer possess around livestock and how quickly most learn to move the 
livestock and gather the errant flock member.  It is no wonder this breed has tested 
consistently higher in HIT and HCT evaluations then many traditional herding breeds.
</p>
<p>
Herding is, in essence, moving livestock in an orderly fashion for a human or under 
direction of a human.  Sheep, goats, cattle, and geese or ducks are animals that dogs 
are commonly asked to move.  Herding should never be confused with chasing.  Chasing 
is a prey-driven activity that benefits the dog in that it is either a fun activity 
to do or it results in a meal, once the chase ends.  Herding dogs should never cause 
undue harm to the stock they move.  There is a moment in the evaluation process where, 
with guidance from the shepherd, the dog understands that he is working for the human 
and begins to understand his role is to move the stock, not kill the stock.  The 
"herding light" comes on, as a Judge recently remarked.
</p>
<p>
There are two distinct styles in herding - one is a field dog and one is that of a 
stock (or yard) dog.  "Field dogs", such as Border Collies or Australian Kelpies, 
cover vast grazing areas, gathering and moving the stock with the dogs often working 
in pairs.  They move livestock by eye control and stalking techniques.  "Stock dogs", 
on the other hand, work in small corrals, chutes and pens to move stock in close 
quarters where there is no room for more than one dog.  Agility, strength, and speed 
are essential characteristics for a stock dog; who control the livestock through grab 
and release techniques, chase, and nipping to elicit cooperation.
</p>
<p>
In 2004, the AKC has permitted the Standard Schnauzer to begin to participate in its 
sanctioned Herding Tests and Trials.  At the Trial level, the Standard Schnauzer has 
"for exhibition only" status until such time as there are enough Standards participating 
at Trials for the AKC to conclude that the breed is in fact able to do the work under 
Trial conditions competently.
</p>
<p>
Up until 2004, the Standard Schnauzer participates in herding tests and trials under 
the auspices of the American Herding Breeds Association (AHBA).
</p>
<p>
To enter an AHBA trial, the dog must be over six months of age and have passed three 
levels of testing, under at least two separate Judges, and have received satisfactory 
scores on the written evaluation for both levels.  
</p>
<p>
Once this is done, you receive a certificate from AHBA to enter trial work.
</p>
<p>
The initial test is the Herding Instinct Test (HIT).   This is the dog's introduction 
to livestock and under direct control of the Judge in the corral, the dog is evaluated 
on his interest in the livestock, how long that interest lasts and the dogs ability to 
move or follow the livestock in some orderly fashion.  This test usually involves dogs 
over six months of age but under the age of 18 months, with little or no exposure to 
livestock on a regular basis.   The purpose of this test is to evaluate the dog's potential 
to herd and it usually includes some displays in poop eating, lots of barking and lots 
of wanting to chase.   Because the dog is under control of the Judge (usually via a long line), 
the Judge is able to focus a wandering dog, calm down an overly excited dog and gauge 
when the dog realizes that it is not there to chase.  As mentioned above, the Judge looks 
for "the herding light comes on" and the desire to control the livestock has replaced 
he desire to chase the livestock.  Some dogs never reach that stage and are not good 
candidates to continue in this sport.
</p>
<p>
Level Two of the instinct test is the Herding Capability Test (HCT).  This level 
requires the owner/handler and the dog to work as a team moving the livestock in a 
controlled manner. The Judge can offer suggestions from outside the arena, but the dog 
and the handler are alone with the livestock. The dog must respond to verbal commands 
and directions from the handler, move the stock, gather the stock, and adjust to the 
movement of the handler.  
</p>
<p>
This test usually requires the handler to move among two pylons (cones / stand alone 
gates or fences are also used) in a figure eight or half circle pattern, passing by 
each cone twice.  The dog must keep the stock in line with the handler, gather a wayward 
member of the flock, and not scatter the stock.  This 
level evaluates the dog's understanding of how to move stock.  Because there is not a 
Judge to control the dog, this level requires the dog approach stock calmly, and for 
the handler to stop the dog and call it to them at the end.  When the HIT and HCT are 
passed satisfactory, the dog can begin further training for trial work.  
</p>
<p>
The evaluation used for the HIT and the HCT covers several areas to gauge the dog's performance.  
</p>
<p>
STYLE:  How the dog moves the livestock.
   Gathering style means the dog keeps the stock together and headed in line with the handler
    Driving style keeps the stock together but the dog works between the handler and the stock.
</p>
<p>
Inexperienced dogs can show both gathering and driving styles in one test, but will 
usually settle in to one style as they get more exposure to stock.
</p>
<p>
APPROACH:  Manner the dog uses to near the stock.
    Wide is the ideal approach for it alerts the stock to the dog's presence without 
	scattering or frightening the stock
    Close is the usual Standard Schnauzer approach and it causes some scattering and 
	may cause the dog to work harder than needed during the test or a trial.
</p>
<p>
EYES:  Eye contact with the stock and concentration on its movements
    Strong eye is that demonstrated by Border Collies and is identified by its stalking, 
	fixated gaze with no acknowledgment of the outside world. 
</p>
<p>
 Loose eye is a dog that has good concentration without the intensity or inability to 
 see or hear the outside world.
</p>
<p>
WEARING:  The back and forth moving needed to keep the stock grouped and stop the 
splitting off of members.
</p>
<p>
BARK:  A silent dog is the preferred worker.  Barking is interpreted by many breeds 
of sheep as inexperience on the dog's behalf.  These sheep breeds will turn and challenge 
the barking dog or refuse to move.
</p>
<p>
TEMPERAMENT:  Refers to the dog's ability to do the job even with outside distractions.
</p>
<p>
INTEREST:  Concentration on the livestock and its movements
</p>
<p>
POWER:  Ability to control the stock and work with them, even if they don't want to work for the dog.
</p>
<p>
RESPONSIVENESS:  Listens to handler and accepts training and directions
</p>
<p>
GROUPING OF THE STOCK:  Judges the consistency of the dog to keep the stock moving in a 
group and regroup straggles or fleeing stock.
</p>
<p>
BALANCING STOCK TO HANDLER:  The dog's position in comparison to the handler and the stock.
</p>
<p>
STOCK EVALUATION:  Behavior of the stock and willingness to work for the dog that is in the arena.
</p>
<p>
Some final thoughts for novice herding dogs and handlers; 
</p>
<p>
Number One ---- practice, practice, practice.
</p>
<p>
Most Standard Schnauzers herd sheep exclusively, although some have demonstrated the 
tenacity to work cattle; so, learning to gauge where you are, as a handler, in relationship 
to the stock and your dog is 
something that is not only necessary to succeed in trial work, but it will help prevent 
injury to yourself, your dog and the livestock.
</p>
<p>
Although you may think you are lucky if you find a training facility that has sheep that 
stick with the handler regardless of the dog's antics - these are nicknamed "Velcro sheep" 
- you should plan on training with sheep that are of a lighter temperament and more flighty, 
as you gain confidence.   Sheep with lighter temperaments are the ones you will most 
likely encounter at tests and in the trial arena and so it is vital that you gain verbal 
control over your dog in order to gain the trust and control over the stock.   
Which leads us to final thought number two?
</p>
<p>
Number Two --- Get Verbal Control over Your Dog
</p>
<p>
We have many CD and CDX obedience titled Standard Schnauzers in the Northern California Club 
who have gone deaf in the herding ring and since your main job as a handler is the protection 
of the sheep, you have to control the dog.
</p>
<p>
Some basic commands needed for herding are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>STAND (Stay or Wait) - needed to stop the dog from charging the sheep on the initial approach; </li>
<li>OUT (or Leave It) - tells the dog not to get so close to the stock; </li>
<li>BACK -- step back further or go back and gather an errand flock member; </li>
<li>AROUND (Away to Me and Come-By) - move to the left or right of my position; </li>
<li>WALK UP - approach slowly from the back of the herd; and </li>
<li>THAT'LL DO - enough, we are done, lets go home.   </li>
</ul>
<p>
If nothing else start with very strong COME and STAY commands during training.  
The other herding commands are easy to work into training sessions as the dog will 
perform them naturally as training progresses.
</p>
<p>
Verbal control is the preferred control method for starting out in herding, but some 
dogs will not heed to a voice command in the heat of the herding passion and you will 
need to resort to "blocking" the dog with a shepherd's crook.  If blocking isn't working 
you may need to shift to the "rattle paddle" which is an oar-like plastic paddle with 
ball bearings inside.  You can re-direct the dog by banging the paddle on the ground to 
gain the dog's attention or by physically moving the dog away with the paddle end placed 
against the dog's side.  Some dogs will require a physical correction upon the body to 
obey the handler.  Because most Standard Schnauzers are fast learners, it is rare that 
you will have to resort to a physical correction to get the dog's focus.
</p>
<p>
Standard Schnauzers perform herding with the same enthusiasm and style that they do everything 
else in their lives.  Some styles I have witnessed over the past two years are amazing.  
I have seen ten and twelve month 
old Standard Schnauzers enter a ring and never chase the sheep as prey.  
They just seem to have an innate sense of what they are in the arena to do. 
Others are more interested in sniffing the ground and the world around them and 
never engage the sheep at all.
</p>
<p>
Others will approach the sheep with mouths open ready to bite - these dogs usually are 
recommended for cattle because of their hearty dispositions.   Dogs have been kicked 
at and had to duck to avoid getting hit by the hooves of a high-flying run away sheep.  
Others become so frenetic that at the sight of the livestock that no one can get them 
to understand they are in the ring to "herd", they only want to chase.  Ironically, 
some of the hardest dogs in the home are the calmest in the area, and visa-versa.
</p>
<p>
Prepare to have your toes stepped on and nearly tripped by passing sheep, 
your dog will go deaf to your commands on occasion and your dog will back talk and 
challenge you every step of the way.  This is a sport that utilizes the dog's natural 
instincts, power, drive and agility and for those of us in the suburbs and the cities, 
it is a nice escape for a few hours - being on a farm and working with livestock 
in a manner befitting the Standard Schnauzer's rural past.
