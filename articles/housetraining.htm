Many years of raising puppies have taught most of the local breeders, that to 
successfully housetrain your Standard Schnauzer puppy, it is important to:
</p>
<ol>
<li>restrict his or her freedom within the home; </li>
<li>regulate their food and water intake to scheduled times during the day;</li>
<li>take the puppy outside on a leash and assign a command to the action of 
elimination (e.g. "go potty",  "hurry up") when the puppy has started to eliminate; </li>
<li>TREAT and PRAISE every time the puppy goes to the bathroom in the appropriate area; and </li>
<li>that puppy does not have the requisite memory or muscle control to hold his waste 
products until they are about 16 weeks old - so expect accidents</li>
</ol>
<p>
It is also important to remember the following rules about WHEN to take your puppy outside to eliminate:
</p>
<ol>
<li>when they awaken from a nap;</li>
<li>anytime the puppy has had a hard play session;</li>
<li>within 10 minutes of eating any treat or meal; and</li>
<li>within 5 minutes of drinking water.</li>
</ol>
<p>
In order to train your pup not to eliminate in the house you must be able to keep 
your eye on him constantly, the easiest way to do this is to restrict him to the 
room you are occupying.  If you can not have the puppy in the room with you where 
you will be able to watch him, then restrict the puppy to his crate or to the puppy 
play area you have designed in an area of your home that is quick to clean up in 
case of accidents, such as the laundry room, kitchen, sun room or any room where 
it is warm and has linoleum or tile flooring.  If you do confine your puppy to a 
crate, do not do so immediately after a meal or water consumption.  A quick rule 
of thumb on how long a puppy should be able to stay in a crate during the day 
without soiling in the crate is 1 hour for each month of age the puppy is: a 2 
month old puppy (8 weeks) 2 hours; a 4 month old puppy (about the time they get 
their Rabies shots) 4 hours.
</p>
<p>
If you are watching your puppy and you start to see signs of him needing to 
go potty, take the puppy outside immediately.  Signs of needing to go potty 
includes: sniffing, circling or leaving a play area and heading to the edge of the room, 
<strong>GRAB THE PUPPY QUICKLY AND HEAD FOR THE NEAREST DOOR.</strong>
Male puppies can continue to walk and urinate as they go, so don't hesitate 
if you see your puppy breaking away from playing to explore.  
</p>
<p>
One of the great advantages of the Standard Schnauzer is that they traditionally 
house break with ease and once trained, rarely have an accident in the home. 
Males may mark as they hit their adolescent period (after 8 months of age) or a 
dog who is ill may have an accident in the home, but these are usually the only 
times an adult Standard will eliminate inside a home.   Additionally, if you adopt 
an older schnauzer who was raised in a kennel situation, expect some housebreaking 
issues and accidents the first several months the dog is in your home.
</p>
<p>
Your pup will be housetrained as quickly, or, slowly, dependent on how diligent 
you are in monitoring his food and water consumption and how quickly you learn 
to recognize the puppy's signs of having to go outside.  
</p>
<p>
The other complaint we hear is:
<blockquote>"We were doing so well and suddenly he has begun to wet in the house again"</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
This happens most of the time because we humans become complacent and think we are 
such good trainers, that the puppy is "housebroken" before he actually has the 
maturity to recognize his or her physical sensations of having to go potty and 
connecting that physical sensation with taking oneself outside to do the job.
</p>
<p>
Don't be discouraged and don't rush things,  keep up the training until you have 
gone at least four weeks without an accident, at this point you can start to relax 
the rules a little bit, but one mistake and tack on another four weeks before you 
loosen the rules again.
