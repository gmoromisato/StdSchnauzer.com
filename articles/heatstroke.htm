The dog days of summer are rapidly approaching and the
consequences of your dog overheating can be deadly.  Here are
some basic mechanics of your dog.s internal cooling system and
the signs and symptoms of heat stress, heat stroke and the
precautions you can take to keep your canine pal cool and active
through the coming summer months
</p>
<p>
Dogs do not cool themselves the same way humans do.  Canine
cooling mechanism is through a process of panting and breathing.
The process of panting moves air over the dog's saliva in their
mouths, and helps to cool them.  Blood vessels in the face, ears
and feet also expand to help dissipate heat.  A dog's normal body
temperature is 100.2* to 102.8* Fahrenheit and when these cooling
mechanisms are overloaded, the body temperature of the dog can
quickly rise to unsafe ranges:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A dog with a temperature of 104 degrees can suffer from
dehydration, heat cramps and heat stress;</li>
<li>A temperature of 106 degrees is a life threatening situation
called heat stroke and the dog needs to be seen by a Veterinarian
ASAP;</li>
<li>Temperatures over 106 degrees can cause heart, brain and kidney
functions to shut down.</li>
</ul>
<p>
SIGNS OF HEAT STROKE:	
</p>
<ul>
<li>Excessive panting;</li>
<li>Increased heart rate;</li>
<li>Confusion or disorientation;</li>
<li>Vomiting or diarrhea;</li>
<li>Bright red gums and tongue; </li>
<li>Collapse, seizure or coma</li>
</ul>
<p>
What to do if you suspect Heat Stroke:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Get your dog out of the heat ASAP;</li>
<li>Begin to SLOWLY cool your dog down using tepid water from a
hose or water soaked towels (change the towels when they no
longer feel cool to touch);</li>
<li>Use an oscillating fan to move air over the dog and cool off
the body;</li>
<li>Apply damp and cool towels to the pads of the feet and ears as
well as the body</li>
<li>Seek Veterinary care IMMEDIATELY</li>
</ul>

<p>
Preventing Heat Stress and Stroke:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Never leave your dog in a car during warm days even for a few
minutes - temperatures inside a car can climb 20 degrees in as
little as 5 minutes;</li>
<li>When it is hot outside - bring your dog inside;</li>
<li>If you have to leave your dog outside provide him with a source
of shade, cool water and ventilation;</li>
<li>A well groomed dog is better able to dissipate body heat than
one whose hair is matted, covered with dirt or laden with an
undercoat that has not shed out.  So include your dog in your
spring cleaning plans.</li>
<li>Always carry water with your for your dog when he is out and
about with you during your summer activities</li>
<li>Exercise your dog in the early morning or late evening hours
during the peak summer heat</li>
</ul>

<p>
Things to use that will keep your pet cool 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Hard plastic wading pools are becoming an increasingly popular
item for keeping dogs cool outside - most can be purchased in the
spring months for under $20.00 at Wal-Mart, Target and Toys-R-Us
retail centers;</li>
<li>Ice cubes and Frosty-Paws canine ice-cream are great treats for
your canine friends on those toasty summer evenings;</li>
<li>Shade tarps and café umbrellas are easy additions to the
backyard to provide additional shade and cut the U-V. exposure to
you and your pets;</li>
<li>Filling liter bottles with water and freezing them make quick
coolers for inside the dog house and as they melt, the dog has a
new cool toy to play with;</li>
<li>Freezing 6x6 ceramic or adobe tiles and placing them in the dog
house or in a shaded area of the yard make for a nice cool place
for your dog to lie and they are reusable</li>
</ul>
<p>
Don't forget that your senior pets are more susceptible to heat
stress than their younger companions, so make certain your senior
pets have easy access to someplace cool to enjoy their afternoon
napping.
