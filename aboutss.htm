	<p class="pfont2" style="text-align:left;">The Standard Schnauzer 
		is a handsome, robust, squarely built, medium sized dog with aristocratic bearing. 
		The original of the 3 sizes of Schnauzers, he is pepper and salt or solid black in 
		color with a wiry minimal-shedding coat. Standard Schnauzers are noted for guarding 
		the home and for their affectionate devotion.
		<br /><br />
		Known as excellent family companions, the Standard Schnauzer also is outstanding 
		as a working dog excelling in conformation, obedience, agility, tracking, herding 
		and therapy. Please explore our site and see our Standard Schnauzers at work and 
		play.

	<span class="fivetypescolor">THE STANDARD SCHNAUZER</span> is a squarely-built, 
		very energetic, medium-sized dog with a stiff, wiry coat. It is a robust and 
		sturdy working dog, yet small enough in stature not to be overwhelming. These 
		traits, combined with a coat which has minimal shedding and &quot;doggy&quot; odor, 
		would lead some to believe this is the ideal dog. However, it is what is on the inside 
		of this extremely agile body that has intrigued fanciers for centuries. This sometimes 
		mischievous, quick and active dog is in reality a reliable working dog with a 
		superbly intelligent mind. This is the dog that is often called &quot;the dog with 
		the human brain&quot;.

	<p class="pfont2"><span class="fivetypescolor">A FAMILY DOG</span>
	that thrives best on close interaction with his human family, it needs the 
	proper outlet for its above-average intelligence that only living as a 
	family dog can provide. The Standard Schnauzer possesses a very clever, 
	inquisitive, creative and sometimes stubbornly determined mind along with 
	a great sense of self-dignity. Properly and carefully raised, they make 
	an affectionate friend and confidante for the children of the immediate family.
	<br /><br />
	</p>
	
	<p class="pfont2"><span class="fivetypescolor">HOME GUARDIAN</span>
	is the Standard Schnauzer's
	middle name. It is very territorial, and the family home is its castle. 
	The arrival of each new stranger is announced with a deep bark that belies 
	its mid-sized stature. Properly introduced, the Standard Schnauzer will accept 
	close family friends into the home but warn away strangers with a deep bark and 
	strong vigor that inspires respect from all.
	<br /><br />
	</p>
	
	<p class="pfont2"><span class="fivetypescolor">MEDIUM-SIZED</span>
	in stature, males ideally 
	are 18-20 inches high at the shoulders and weigh 35-50 pounds. The females 
	ideally are 17-19 inches high at the shoulders and generally weigh 30-45 pounds.
	<br /><br />
	</p>
	
	<p class="pfont2"><span class="fivetypescolor">LEARNING VERY QUICKLY</span>
		, the Standard Schnauzer can 
		ideally excel in all performance dog sports. Like a mischievous and very bright 
		child, they need consistent rules and a firm, but not rough, hand. They will 
		get away with whatever they can and will &quot;rule the roost&quot; before you 
		know it, if allowed. One cannot ever forget there is a Standard Schnauzer in the house.
		<br /><br />
	</p>
	
	<p class="pfont2"><span class="fivetypescolor">REQUIREMENTS:</span>
		<br />
		THE STANDARD SCHNAUZER is a 
		very adaptable dog. Although some breeders will not sell a puppy to anyone who 
		does not have a fenced yard and others will require at least one non-working 
		family member, the truth is that the Standard Schnauzer fits into almost any 
		lifestyle or environment. Many Standard Schnauzers will accept sharing the house 
		with cats, especially if introduced to them at an early age. However, small 
		members of the rodent family kept as pets should always be kept in secure cages 
		to ensure their safety. The hereditary instincts of their origins as a rat-catcher 
		are extremely strong in many of today's Standard Schnauzers.
		<br />
		<br />
		The Standard Schnauzer is considered a high-energy dog. They need ample 
		exercise not only for physical well-being, but for emotional well-being. 
		The minimum amount an adult dog should get is the equivalent of a one-mile
		walk at least three times a day. These walks should be brisk enough to keep the 
		dog at a steady trotting pace in order to keep the dog in prime physical condition. 
		The Standard Schnauzer puppy is constantly exploring, learning and testing his limits. 
		As adults, they are always ready for a walk in the woods, a ride in the car, a 
		training session or any other activity that allows them to be with their owner. 
		This is a breed that knows how to be on the alert, even when relaxing by the feet 
		of their owner.
