			The Standard Schnauzer originated in Germany.  The breed is considered very 
old - Schnauzer-like dogs appear in tapestries and paintings.   In Stutquard, 
there is a 14th century statue entitled "The Night Watchman" and at his side 
is a Schnauzer of medium size and resemblance to today's Standard Schnauzer.
<br /><br />
The breed was first exhibited in 1879 as the "Wire Haired Pinscher" when a dog 
named "Schnauzer" made his debut into the show ring of the Third International 
All Breed Show in Hanover, Germany and won first prize.   The first Breed 
Standard was recorded in 1880 in the German Kennel Club Stud Book.    
Although the Standard Schnauzer's ancestry is disputed, it has always 
been noted for its sharp intelligence and a lively and reliable personality.
<br /><br />Through

the years, the Standard Schnauzer has proven its worth as a companion and 
as a working dog.   In the years preceding World War I, the Standard Schnauzers 
were often seen in the European open markets, 
guarding a farmer's cart and merchandise.   
These dogs were invaluable to the farmers as guardian and ratters.  During 
World&nbsp;War&nbsp;I and II the Standard Schnauzer was used as dispatch carriers 
and as aides for Red Cross.   They were also used in Police Work and remain the s
mallest dog in stature to do so.
<br /><br />
The Standard Schnauzer had its beginnings in Germany but can be found throughout the 
world and remains a popular work and companion dog in the United States, Russia, 
Switzerland, Australia and Canada.
<br /><br />
The first Standard Schnauzers came to the United States around 1900 but it was not until 
1904 that the AKC registered the first Standard Schnauzer.   During the 1920s the Standard 
Schnauzer enjoyed immense popularity in California and on the East Coast of the United States 
and the first National Breed Club was formed in 1925.   In 1926 the Wire-Haired Pinscher 
officially changed its name to Standard Schnauzer.  That was also the first year that the 
Standard Schnauzer was moved from the Working Group into the Terrier Group where it remained 
until 1945.
<br /><br />
In the United States the Standard Schnauzer has been primarily a companion and guard dog.   
His love for family, his fearlessness and reliability make him well suited for the family life.  
For the individuals who value courage, reliability and intelligence, there is no better 
dog than the Standard Schnauzer.
