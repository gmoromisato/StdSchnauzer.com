<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Mary Hudson was a long-time Standard Schnauzer lover who’s first Standard 
was a rescue dog in the 1980s.   Mary and her first Standard were inseparable 
and worked together in obedience.   Mary became an active member of the  
Northern California Standard Schnauzer Club in the late 1990s and her influence, 
talent and friendships echo through the club today.
</p>
<p>Mary’s first official “show” Standard was “Ruby” (CH. Madonna Aruba Von Berg, CGC, CD) 
and like her first rescued Standard, Mary and Ruby were inseparable.  
</p>
<p>Mary succumbed to cancer in September of 2002 after a nine month battle 
and ten days later, Ruby was struck and killed by an automobile.   
Their ashes were spread together by Mary’s family and all that knew Mary and Ruby 
felt that would be what they both wanted – to be together even after death.
</p>

<p>
SSCNC wishes to honor Mary Hudson’s positive influence as a 
club member and we dedicate this trophy to an outstanding member of the 
Standard Schnauzer Communities.
